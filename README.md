# Simulation-of-intelligent-platform-BDI
Contains the code for the port model (pure C#), the factory platform and the takeaway platform based on Unity project. Unzipped and ready to use.

The plant model is a multi-level scheduling model. The takeout platform is written in a hurry, and there are some logical errors. Users should understand the content to rewrite part of the logical errors.
